## Abstract 

Have you ever wished you could dramatically speed up your Python code? What about adding functionality to your C project
without the possibility of introducing a footgun? Perhaps you simply want to know why Rust has been the #1 most loved
programming language (according to StackOverflow users) every year since 2016? Don’t let your dreams be dreams!

This talk will cover the good aspects of Rust as well as the bad. Additionally, we’ll discuss Rust’s recent upswing in
adoption at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Finally, we’ll examine a few practical examples such as boosting
a Python fuzzer’s performance and showcasing interoperability with C, all while highlighting different aspects of Rust
itself. After all, what would a talk about a programming language be without code?

This talk is aimed at anyone who wants to know more about Rust and what makes it so awesome! Attendees will walk away
able to determine if Rust is a good fit for their next project. Furthermore, Python and C folks will leave with some
reasons to integrate Rust into existing projects, including increases to speed and memory safety.
